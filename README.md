# Software Engineering Project

## Project name
**Binary file handling tool**

### Background

Viewing the contents of binary files is usually troublesome and requires software tools be  used  which  support  a  given  file  format.   It  may  be  helpful  to  develop  a  tool  for viewing such files of a defined format with an option to export them to a text file.

### Task description

The aim of this project is to develop a tool for reading the binary files and making it possible to export them (or a part of them) to a text file (of a format defined by the user).  The following issues should be addressed:

1. Structure of the binary file should be specified by the user – the tool should allow for defining both linear and iterative structures (note that the number of iterations may be written in the binary file).
2. Once defined, the file structure could be serialized.  A list of several recently used formats should be available in the GUI. The same applies to the recent file folder.
3. The GUI should be intuitive and easy to use, saving the user’s effort to operate the program.
4. The data read from the file should be presented as text and the data could be stored to a text file (entirely or partially).
5. Batch processing (i.e., conversion of entire set of files) should be available.
